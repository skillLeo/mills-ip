# CLAUDE.md — Mills IP Trademark Search & Application Platform

## Project Overview

This is a full Laravel rebuild of a trademark search and application platform for **Mills IP**, an
Australian trademark attorney firm. The old system was raw legacy PHP with no framework, no
structure, and inadequate security. This rebuild starts from scratch.

The platform has two sides:
- **Public side** — Anyone can search the IP Australia trademark database and submit a
  five-step trademark application form.
- **Admin side** — The Mills IP legal team logs in privately to manage, track, and update all
  incoming applications.

**Current build scope: Phase 1 only** — Foundation, database, admin auth, and live trademark
search via the IP Australia API.

## Client Context

| Field         | Detail                                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Developer     | Aydin (intermediary agency developer)                     |
| End Client    | Mills IP — Australian trademark attorney firm             |
| Market        | Australia — businesses and individuals                    |
| Stage         | MVP — concept validation before further investment        |
| Future        | May rebrand as TM.com.au powered by Mills IP              |
                                      |

> Quality matters significantly — Mills IP is a key client of Aydin's agency.

## IP Australia API — How It Works

The trademark search uses **OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow**.

### Step 1 — Fetch Access Token
```
POST {IP_AUSTRALIA_TOKEN_URL}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id={IP_AUSTRALIA_CLIENT_ID}
&client_secret={IP_AUSTRALIA_CLIENT_SECRET}

Response: { "access_token": "...", "expires_in": 3600 }
```

### Step 2 — Search Trademarks
```
GET {IP_AUSTRALIA_BASE_URL}/trademarks/search?q={brand_name}
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

Response: Array of matching trademark records
```

### Service class location
```
app/Services/IPAustraliaService.php
```

The service class handles:
- Token fetching and caching (cache the token for its TTL, don't fetch on every request)
- Injecting the Bearer token into search requests
- Returning clean, structured results to the controller
- Error handling if the API is unavailable

---

## Admin Authentication

- Uses Laravel's built-in session authentication
- Guard: `web` (default)
- No public registration — admin accounts created manually via seeder
- All admin routes wrapped in `auth` middleware
- Session expires after inactivity (configured in `config/session.php`)

### Admin routes are defined in `routes/admin.php` and registered in `RouteServiceProvider`

```php
// All admin routes require authentication
Route::middleware(['auth'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index']);
    // ... more routes
});

// Login routes are public
Route::get('/admin/login', [AuthController::class, 'showLogin']);
Route::post('/admin/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
Route::post('/admin/logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout']);
```

---

## Security Requirements

These are non-negotiable — this platform handles personal and legal data:

- ✅ CSRF tokens on every form (Laravel handles automatically with `@csrf`)
- ✅ All user input validated before processing (use Laravel Form Requests)
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (never stored plain)
- ✅ Admin routes protected by auth middleware — no exceptions
- ✅ Uploaded files stored in `storage/app/private/` — not in `public/`
- ✅ No raw SQL — use Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ XSS protection via Blade's `{{ }}` auto-escaping (never use `{!! !!}` on user input)
- ✅ `.env` file never committed to version control

---

## Application Status Values

These are the only valid status values for an application:

```
Received   (default on submission)
Reviewing
Quoted
Filed
Completed
On Hold
Rejected
```

Store as an enum or a constants class. Never allow arbitrary string values.

---

## File Upload Rules

- Logo uploads accepted in Phase 2
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WEBP
- Max file size: to be confirmed (suggest 5MB)
- Store in: `storage/app/private/logos/`
- File path saved in `applications.logo_file_path`
- Files must NOT be publicly browsable — serve via authenticated controller method only

---

## Build Phases

### ✅ Phase 1 — Current Scope
- [ ] Laravel project scaffolded and running
- [ ] `.env` configured with DB and API placeholders
- [ ] All database migrations created and run cleanly
- [ ] AdminUser seeder created — first admin account seeded
- [ ] Admin login page built and working
- [ ] Admin logout working
- [ ] Admin routes protected — unauthenticated users redirected to login
- [ ] `IPAustraliaService` class built with OAuth token fetch
- [ ] Trademark search controller and route created
- [ ] Public search page (homepage) built with search bar
- [ ] Search results page built — displays real API results
- [ ] API credentials integrated from `.env` — search tested live

### 🔜 Phase 2 — Not Yet Started
- Five-step application form
- Logo file upload
- Database submission on form complete
- Two automated emails on submission
- Submission confirmation page

### 🔜 Phase 3 — Not Yet Started
- Admin dashboard (applications list, search, filter)
- Application detail page
- Status management
- Internal notes panel
- Audit history log
- Full testing, bug fixing, deployment

---

## Hard Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| IP Australia API credentials (Client ID, Secret, Token URL, Base URL) | Cannot build or test trademark search | ⚠️ Awaiting from client |
| SMTP credentials | Cannot build or test emails (Phase 2) | ⚠️ Awaiting from client |
| Hosting environment details | Cannot deploy (Phase 3) | ⚠️ Awaiting from client |

---

## Key Decisions & Constraints

- **Full rebuild in Laravel** — no patching of old raw PHP codebase. Decision is final.
- **MVP scope is fixed** — no features added without explicit client approval.
- **No payment processing** — out of scope for this MVP entirely.
- **Rebrand-ready** — design and code must support a domain/logo swap to TM.com.au without a rebuild.
- **Modular architecture** — must be able to add payment gateway and new features in future phases without structural changes to core.
- **Two submission emails are non-negotiable** — must fire reliably every single time.
- **Audit history log is permanent** — no update or delete operations ever allowed on that table.

---

## What Success Looks Like (Phase 1)

Phase 1 is complete when:
1. `php artisan serve` runs with no errors
2. `php artisan migrate` creates all tables cleanly
3. Admin can log in at `/admin/login` with seeded credentials
4. Unauthenticated users cannot access any `/admin/*` route
5. A brand name typed into the public search bar returns real trademark results from the IP Australia government database
6. The search results page displays those results clearly on screen
